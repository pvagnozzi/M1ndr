<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Runs the main build process for the solution.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script acts as a wrapper for the C#-based build project (build/build.csproj).
    It uses a sophisticated build system managed by Nuke, invoked via `dotnet run`.
    All build logic (Clean, Restore, Build, Test, Pack) is defined in the C# project.
.PARAMETER args
    Arguments to pass to the underlying build project.
.EXAMPLE
    ./build.ps1 --target Clean,Restore,Build
.EXAMPLE
    ./build.ps1 --help
